# asgn1 superoptimizer

## was this a good idea? hmmmm

the idea was to make a simple language, and then generate all possible expressions in that language that would be equivalent to a specified value

You can see a definition for a language in asgn1.rkt. check.rkt generates all possible arithmetic binary operations that have two levels max. Then I ran through all of the generated expressions to see which ones were equal to a specified value.
